Patches is a basic set of patches for an imported
OpenBSD vanilla source code.

The plan is to make this as easy as possible to patch 
when new versions arrive.

The structure of the patches is is based on the patches we need
for compatibility (aka undefined stuff in other operating systems
that aren't BSD) and the others that we need for the source to run.

It is strongly recommended to try and patch for both Darwin and Linux, 
remember that, libc's are different, so there is no such thing as universal 
patches. In order to achieve this, you should use compiler macros.

To create a patch, you need to use the diff tool, and it needs to be able to be applied 
using 'patch -p0'. For example:

    cd src/arch/
    cp -p arch.c arch.c.orig
    # edit arch.c
    mkdir -p ../../patches/src/arch
    diff -u arch.c.orig arch.c > ../../patches/src/arch/arch.c.patch

NOTE: All patches are applied *after* common edits to source files are
done by import-src.sh.  Be sure to look at that script first if you
need clarification on what fits that category.

Also remember to add credits to CREDITS file in this subdirectory in case
some of the patches are by third parties.

Happy hacking!
