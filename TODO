- FIXME Darwin: 
      - Join doesn't build (I don't know what it lacks, but however I am fixing it)

- Maybe incorporate find and xargs in to the tree.

- Maybe incorporate bc and dc in to the tree.

- Maybe incorporate diffutils in to the tree (diff, diff3, sdiff).

- Update import-src.sh to be able to import new versions and overlay them
  in the source tree so the tree can try to keep up with upstream.

- The following utilities don't have CMakeFiles and dont build:
      - df
      - tail

- Make a ORIGIN file, that says where did we get each port from
