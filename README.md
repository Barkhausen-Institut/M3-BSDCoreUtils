## The \*BSD utils project

This project is a GNU coreutils-like collection of utilities from diverse BSD operating systems (FreeBSD, OpenBSD and NetBSD). The intent is to offer a BSD-licensed and lightweight replacement for the GNU coreutils project.

## Installation

Here are some instructions to get this collection of tools running on your computer!

**Option 1 - Precompiled bin**:

If you don't wish to compile, there is a precompiled bin option, for the macOS operating system.

In order to achieve this, just follow these instructions:

1. Install [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) for macOS.
2. Go to your terminal, and execute the following command `brew tap diegomagdaleno/homebrew-diegoutils`
3. Now run `brew install bsd-coreutils`

_Note: These tools will be installed with the "b" prefix, for example "bcat" instead of "cat"._

_Note 2: BSDCoreutils precompiled bins will be available for diverse Linux distributions eventually_

**Option 2 - From source**:

Building from source is a recommended option if you want to read and wish to take control over what you install on your computer.

1. Make sure you have `openssl` installed, including development libraries (Header files, etc)Â³
2. Make sure you have the CMake toolchain installed (Google how to install it for your operating system)
3. Open your terminal, and `cd` in to the directory where you cloned/downloaded.
4. Run `mkdir build && cd build`
5. Run `cmake ..`
6. Run `make`

_3. This is only required on Linux based operating systems, on macOS the native implementation of the hashing algorithms will be used_
